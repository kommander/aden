# Attitudes
Adens core is a blank slate. She has no behaviour unless you give her an attitude.
Our opinions have been defaulted and exported into attitudes.
Attitudes describe how aden handles filetypes. You can write your own attitude if you don't find one that suits your needs.

Aden has default attitudes for `.html`, `.js`, `.css`, `.md` and `.hbs` files for now.
Additionally she comes with attitudes to handle basic web application tasks and setup,
like `favicons`, `statuspages`, `controllers` and a `layout` wrapper for your html output.
