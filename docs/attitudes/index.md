# Attitudes
Aden has default attitudes for `.html`, `.js`, `.css`, `md` and `.hbs` files for now.
Her core is conceptionally unopinionated. Our opinions have been defaulted and exported into attitudes.
Attitudes describe how aden handles filetypes. You can write your own attitude if you don't find one that suits your needs.
