# Attitudes
Adens core is a blank slate. She has no behaviour unless you give her an attitude,
to describe how aden should handle specific filetypes. You can write your own attitude if you don't find one that suits your needs.

Our opinions have been defaulted and exported into default attitudes for `.html`, `.js`, `.css`, `.md` and `.hbs` files.
Additionally she comes with attitudes to handle basic web application tasks and setup,
like `favicons`, `statuspages`, `controllers` and a `layout` wrapper for your html output. Additional _webpack plugins/features_ are defaulted for `vendor` libraries and `copy` static assets.

Read about the attitudes and the exposed features and behaviour:
