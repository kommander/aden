# [DEPRECATED] :seedling: Aden
> Automated Server for the Web.

Aden lets you create static or dynamic sites using a framework of your choice (like React, Inferno, Angular, Vue). 

Aden integrates [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack),
[Babel](https://babeljs.io) and
[Express](http://expressjs.com/) with an extensible [file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file) [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_data_structure) [parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing),
to generate universal frontend asset builds and allow for a classic webserver behaviour, mapping paths to routes, while setting up a non-mutable express app for production. Aden also allows for straight forward server side rendering and API development.

The _/docs_ from this repository are running on _aden_ on a heroku instance at [aden.zwerk.io](https://aden.zwerk.io).
