// TODO: let .aden have { client: { config: {} } } field,
// which can be extended by hooks etc. and is hosted at a default json endpoint.
// (can be automatically rendered into template as global data)
// The lib/client/index can take care of loading the config, triggering an app start.
// It could also provide a default splash screen / loading screen.
